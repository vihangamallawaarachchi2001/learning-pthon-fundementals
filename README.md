## 🌟 About

This repo is a practical companion to the video tutorial series "Learn the fundamentals of Python". It includes complete Python scripts, exercises, and mini-projects that reinforce each concept introduced in the lessons.

---

## 🛠 What You'll Learn

* Installing and setting up Python
* Basic syntax: variables, data types, input/output
* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Looping constructs: `for` and `while` loops
* Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
* Writing and using functions
* Exception handling and debugging
* Working with files (reading/writing text files)
* (Optional) Intro to modules and packages

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+ installed on your machine

### Installation

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-fundamentals.git
   cd python-fundamentals
   ```
2. \[Optional] Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```
3. Install any dependencies (if applicable, typically none for fundamentals):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

Each folder contains scripts and exercises. To run an example:

```bash
cd control_flow
python if_statements.py
```

Review outputs, inspect the code, and experiment with modifications. For exercises, there are comments hinting at what to implement—feel free to challenge yourself!

---

## 💡 Code Examples

* `basics/variables.py` – shows different data types and basic printing
* `control_flow/loops.py` – demonstrates `for` and `while` loops with custom logic
* `exceptions/try_example.py` – illustrates typical use of `try/except/finally` blocks
* `file_io/read_write.py` – covers reading from and writing to text files

Each script includes clear comments and can be extended or modified for better understanding.
